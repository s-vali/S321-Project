<br>The repository contains the original code in the Python Jupyter titled "ORIGINAL_Android_Malware_Analysis___TEEP_Internship.ipynb" file as well as each file where the data poisoning attacks 'deleting', 'modifying & injecting' and 'label flipping' can be found. However, it will be more useful to check to the 'merged' python jupyter file as it contains all of the data poisoning attacks and momdels in one file. Further, the cybersecurity dataset used for the models can be found in "train.csv" where the csv was opened in the code at the same folder level as the jupyter notebook file. Moreover, our analysis concerns only the Naive Bayes Model and none others. 

<br>NOTE: Our analysis is for the section "Android Malware Analysis" only and not "Dynamic Analysis".
